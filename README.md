# SCT_ML_4
## Problem Statement : Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.
### Description : 
This project focuses on developing a Hand Gesture Recognition Model that accurately identifies and classifies different hand gestures from image and video data. The goal is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems. The model leverages computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to process and analyze gesture patterns.
